                <br> - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result gets added to his/her ROUND score
                <br> - BUT, if the player rolls a '1' ( if get '1' in dice rolling), all his Round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                <br> - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                <br> - The first player to reach Winning Score on GLOBAL score wins the game. (Winning Score will be decided by you..!!) </div>
