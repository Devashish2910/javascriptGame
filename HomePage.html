- The game has 2 players and there are 2 dices. <br>
- In each turn, a player rolls dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his &nbsp;&nbsp;ROUND score.<br>
- BUT, if...<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a player gets a 1 in any one dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;player's turn.<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 12 (6 + 6 two times) in a row. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After that,it's the next player's turn.<br>
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. <br>
- And then it's next player turn.<br>
- The first player to reach Winning Total points on GLOBAL score wins the game. (Players will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide the winning score..!!)<br> </div>
