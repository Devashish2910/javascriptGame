GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players and there are two dices. 
- In each turn, a player rolls dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if...
    - a player gets a 1 in any one dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
    - a player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 12 (6 + 6 two times) in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach Winning Total points on GLOBAL score wins the game. (Players will decide the winning score..!!)
